## Project Setup

_After cloning, the following steps setup the project_

- `cd Booking-app` to change the current working directory.
- `git checkout development` to access the most recent files and features.
- `bundle install` to install all necessary dependencies.
- `rails db:create` && `rails db:migrate` to create database and tables.
- `rails db:seed` to populate database with Dummie data.
- `though i made a user an admin to create the cars data. you can also do that if you want`
- `rails s` to start the application. You're all set.
  Feel free to use POSTMAN or any other similar infrastructure to test the different endpoints.

  To run test suites included, run:

- `bundle exec rspec`

## API Documentation

> The base URL for all endpoints is `https://gothic-serpent.herokuapp.com/api/v1/`. Some requests requires validation while some does not. The validation is implemented using tokens generated by JWT upon registration or login. This token is then sent with the headers of the requests that requires validation, so that it can be decoded and the app can determine if the token is valid or not. If valid, the user can successfully access such end-points that requires authentication.

**Summary of Available API Endpoints**
| Endpoint | Feature | Authentication |
| ------------ | ------------| ---------- |
| POST /users | Registers a new user | False |
| POST /login | Logs in a user | False |
| GET /autologin | Checks login status of the current user | True |
| POST /bookings | Creates a new booking | True |
| GET /bookings | Fetches all available booking for logged user | True |
| GET /cars | Fetches all available cars | False |
| GET /cars/:id | Fetches the details of a specific car | False |

**Sampling a request that requires authentication**

_Fetch bookings: endpoint fetches all the bookings already booked by the logged in user. Therefore, it requires authorization._

Endpoint: `https://gothic-serpent.herokuapp.com/api/v1/bookings`

Request (from POSTMAN):

```js
token = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.JC6qKuH9SG0SIiYSfhZUFTtirxN9Q47buLk0DPFFFzE'
curl --location --request GET 'https://gothic-serpent.herokuapp.com/api/v1/bookings' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "date_created": "2020-12-08T11:14:06.414Z",
    "id": 6,
    "date": "2020-12-09T13:15:00.000Z",
    "description": "I need a car for my wedding",
    "duration": "90",
    "car_id": 2,
    "city": "madrid",
    "username": "precious"
  }
]
```

**Sampling a request that DOES NOT require authentication**

_Login: endpoint fetches creates a new token and ensure that the user can access all features._

Endpoint: `https://gothic-serpent.herokuapp.com/api/v1/login`

Request (From POSTMAN):

```js
curl --location --request POST 'https://gothic-serpent.herokuapp.com/api/v1/login' \
--form 'emaill="johndoe@yahoo.com"' \
--form 'password="password"'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@doe.com"
  },
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.JC6qKuH9SG0SIiYSfhZUFTtirxN9Q47buLk0DPFFFzE",
  "logged_In": true
}
```
